{"prompt": "Below is a competitive programming question. Read the question carefully.\n\n*Instruction*\nDevelop a well-structured Python solution for the provided problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. \n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```.\n\n### Example 1\n\nPolycarp has $n$ different binary words. A word called binary if it contains only characters '0' and '1'. For example, these words are binary: \"0001\", \"11\", \"0\" and \"0011100\".\n\nPolycarp wants to offer his set of $n$ binary words to play a game \"words\". In this game, players name words and each next word (starting from the second) must start with the last character of the previous word. The first word can be any. For example, these sequence of words can be named during the game: \"0101\", \"1\", \"10\", \"00\", \"00001\".\n\nWord reversal is the operation of reversing the order of the characters. For example, the word \"0111\" after the reversal becomes \"1110\", the word \"11010\" after the reversal becomes \"01011\".\n\nProbably, Polycarp has such a set of words that there is no way to put them in the order correspondent to the game rules. In this situation, he wants to reverse some words from his set so that:  the final set of $n$ words still contains different words (i.e. all words are unique);  there is a way to put all words of the final set of words in the order so that the final sequence of $n$ words is consistent with the game rules. \n\nPolycarp wants to reverse minimal number of words. Please, help him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 the number of words in the Polycarp's set. Next $n$ lines contain these words. All of $n$ words aren't empty and contains only characters '0' and '1'. The sum of word lengths doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$. All words are different.\n\nGuaranteed, that the sum of $n$ for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $2\\cdot10^5$. Also, guaranteed that the sum of word lengths for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint answer for all of $t$ test cases in the order they appear.\n\nIf there is no answer for the test case, print -1. Otherwise, the first line of the output should contain $k$ ($0 \\le k \\le n$) \u2014 the minimal number of words in the set which should be reversed. The second line of the output should contain $k$ distinct integers \u2014 the indexes of the words in the set which should be reversed. Words are numerated from $1$ to $n$ in the order they appear. If $k=0$ you can skip this line (or you can print an empty line). If there are many answers you can print any of them.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n4\n0001\n1000\n0011\n0111\n3\n010\n101\n0\n2\n00000\n00001\n4\n01\n001\n0001\n00001\n\nOutput\n1\n3 \n-1\n0\n\n2\n1 2\n\n### RESPONSE:\n\n```python \nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    n = int(input())\n    mass = []\n    zo = 0\n    oz = 0\n    zz = 0\n    oo = 0\n    ozs = []\n    zos = []\n    ozss = set()\n    zoss = set()\n    for j in range(n):\n        k = input()\n        mass.append(k)\n        if k[0] == '0' and k[-1] == '1':\n            zoss.add(k)\n            zos.append(j + 1)\n            zo += 1\n        elif k[0] == '1' and k[-1] == '0':\n            ozss.add(k)\n            ozs.append(j + 1)\n            oz += 1\n        elif k[0] == '0' and k[-1] == '0':\n            zz += 1\n        else:\n            oo += 1\n    if zz and oo and not oz and not zo:\n        print(-1)\n        continue\n    else:\n        if zo > oz:\n            print((zo - oz) // 2)\n            ans = []\n            need = (zo - oz) // 2\n            i = 0\n            while need:\n                zzz = mass[zos[i] - 1][len(mass[zos[i] - 1]) - 1:: -1]\n                if zzz not in ozss:\n                    ans.append(zos[i])\n                    need -= 1\n                i += 1\n            print(*ans)\n        else:\n            print((oz - zo) // 2)\n            ans = []\n            need = (oz - zo) // 2\n            i = 0\n            while need:\n                zzz = mass[ozs[i] - 1][len(mass[ozs[i] - 1]) - 1:: -1]\n                if zzz not in zoss:\n                    ans.append(ozs[i])\n                    need -= 1\n                i += 1\n            print(*ans)\n```\n\n-----------------\n\n### Example 2\n\nToday, the memorable AtCoder Beginner Contest 100 takes place. On this occasion, Takahashi would like to give an integer to Ringo.\n\nAs the name of the contest is AtCoder Beginner Contest 100, Ringo would be happy if he is given a positive integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times.\nFind the N-th smallest integer that would make Ringo happy.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - D is 0, 1 or 2.\n - N is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nD N\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the N-th smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n0 5\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n5\n\nThe integers that can be divided by 100 exactly 0 times (that is, not divisible by 100) are as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...\n\nThus, the 5-th smallest integer that would make Ringo happy is 5.\n\n\n\n### RESPONSE:\n", "output": ["\nThe problem asks you to find the Nth smallest integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times. You need to take D and N as input and then find the Nth integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can use a loop that starts from 1 and increments by 1 until the Nth integer is found. In each iteration, you can check if the current number is divisible by 100 exactly D times. If it is, print it and exit the loop. If it's not, continue the loop.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n\n```python\nd, n = map(int, input().split())\nnum = 1\nwhile n > 0:\n    if num % 100 ** d == 0:\n        print(num)\n        n -= 1\n    num += 1\n```\n\nThis code reads D and N from the input, then initializes num to 1. It runs a loop until it finds the Nth integer that can be divided by 100 exactly D times. If it finds such an integer, it prints it and exits the loop. Otherwise, it continues to the next number.\n\nYou can test the code with the given sample input to ensure that it works correctly. ", "Please provide the solution for this problem.

The game is as follows:\n\nPolycarp starts with a card with number $k_1$ and his friend starts with a card with number $k_2$. In each turn, the player who has the card with the lower number must choose a card with number $k_i$ and replace it with a card with number $k_{i+1}$. If the player has no card with number $k_{i+1}$, he loses the game. If the player has cards with numbers $k_{i+1}$ and $k_{i+2}$, he can choose either of them.\n\nPolycarp wants to win the game.

He can choose cards with the following numbers: 4, 5, 2, 4, 5, 1, 2. In the first turn, he chooses the card with number 3 and his friend chooses the card with number 4. In the second turn, he chooses the card with number 2 and his friend chooses the card with number 5. In the third turn, he chooses the card with number 4 again and his friend chooses the card with number 2. In the fourth turn, he chooses the card with number 5 and his friend chooses the card with number 1. In the fifth turn, he chooses the card with number 2 again, and the game ends.\n\n\n### RESPONSE:\n\nASSISTANT:\n\n```python\nn, k1 = map(int, input().split())\n\nif k1 == 1:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelif k1 == n:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n-----------------\n\n### Example 4\n\nPolycarp has $n$ different binary words.
