{"prompt": "Below is a competitive programming question. Read the question carefully.\n\n*Instruction*\nDevelop a well-structured Python solution for the provided problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. \n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```.\n\n### Example 1\n\nPolycarp has $n$ different binary words. A word called binary if it contains only characters '0' and '1'. For example, these words are binary: \"0001\", \"11\", \"0\" and \"0011100\".\n\nPolycarp wants to offer his set of $n$ binary words to play a game \"words\". In this game, players name words and each next word (starting from the second) must start with the last character of the previous word. The first word can be any. For example, these sequence of words can be named during the game: \"0101\", \"1\", \"10\", \"00\", \"00001\".\n\nWord reversal is the operation of reversing the order of the characters. For example, the word \"0111\" after the reversal becomes \"1110\", the word \"11010\" after the reversal becomes \"01011\".\n\nProbably, Polycarp has such a set of words that there is no way to put them in the order correspondent to the game rules. In this situation, he wants to reverse some words from his set so that:  the final set of $n$ words still contains different words (i.e. all words are unique);  there is a way to put all words of the final set of words in the order so that the final sequence of $n$ words is consistent with the game rules. \n\nPolycarp wants to reverse minimal number of words. Please, help him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 the number of words in the Polycarp's set. Next $n$ lines contain these words. All of $n$ words aren't empty and contains only characters '0' and '1'. The sum of word lengths doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$. All words are different.\n\nGuaranteed, that the sum of $n$ for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $2\\cdot10^5$. Also, guaranteed that the sum of word lengths for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint answer for all of $t$ test cases in the order they appear.\n\nIf there is no answer for the test case, print -1. Otherwise, the first line of the output should contain $k$ ($0 \\le k \\le n$) \u2014 the minimal number of words in the set which should be reversed. The second line of the output should contain $k$ distinct integers \u2014 the indexes of the words in the set which should be reversed. Words are numerated from $1$ to $n$ in the order they appear. If $k=0$ you can skip this line (or you can print an empty line). If there are many answers you can print any of them.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n4\n0001\n1000\n0011\n0111\n3\n010\n101\n0\n2\n00000\n00001\n4\n01\n001\n0001\n00001\n\nOutput\n1\n3 \n-1\n0\n\n2\n1 2\n\n### RESPONSE:\n\n```python \nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    n = int(input())\n    mass = []\n    zo = 0\n    oz = 0\n    zz = 0\n    oo = 0\n    ozs = []\n    zos = []\n    ozss = set()\n    zoss = set()\n    for j in range(n):\n        k = input()\n        mass.append(k)\n        if k[0] == '0' and k[-1] == '1':\n            zoss.add(k)\n            zos.append(j + 1)\n            zo += 1\n        elif k[0] == '1' and k[-1] == '0':\n            ozss.add(k)\n            ozs.append(j + 1)\n            oz += 1\n        elif k[0] == '0' and k[-1] == '0':\n            zz += 1\n        else:\n            oo += 1\n    if zz and oo and not oz and not zo:\n        print(-1)\n        continue\n    else:\n        if zo > oz:\n            print((zo - oz) // 2)\n            ans = []\n            need = (zo - oz) // 2\n            i = 0\n            while need:\n                zzz = mass[zos[i] - 1][len(mass[zos[i] - 1]) - 1:: -1]\n                if zzz not in ozss:\n                    ans.append(zos[i])\n                    need -= 1\n                i += 1\n            print(*ans)\n        else:\n            print((oz - zo) // 2)\n            ans = []\n            need = (oz - zo) // 2\n            i = 0\n            while need:\n                zzz = mass[ozs[i] - 1][len(mass[ozs[i] - 1]) - 1:: -1]\n                if zzz not in zoss:\n                    ans.append(ozs[i])\n                    need -= 1\n                i += 1\n            print(*ans)\n```\n\n-----------------\n\n### Example 2\n\nGiven is a string S representing the day of the week today.\nS is SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, or SAT, for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, respectively.\nAfter how many days is the next Sunday (tomorrow or later)?\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - S is SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, or SAT.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the number of days before the next Sunday.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\nSAT\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n1\n\nIt is Saturday today, and tomorrow will be Sunday.\n\n\n\n### RESPONSE:\n", "output": ["What is the input format and constraints for this problem?
