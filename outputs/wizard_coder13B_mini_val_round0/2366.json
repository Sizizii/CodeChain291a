For example, these words are binary: \"0001\", \"11\", \"0\" and \"0011100\".\n\nPolycarp wants to offer his set of $n$ binary words to play a game \"words\". In this game, players name words and each next word (starting from the second) must start with the last character of the previous word. The first word can be any. For example, these sequence of words can be named during the game: \"0101\", \"1\", \"10\", \"00\", \"00001\".\n\nWord reversal is the operation of reversing the order of the characters. For example, the word \"0111\" after the reversal becomes \"1110\", the word \"11010\" after the reversal becomes \"01011\".\n\nProbably, Polycarp has such a set of words that there is no way to put them in the order correspondent to the game rules. In this situation, he wants to reverse some words from his set so that:  the final set of $n$ words still contains different words (i.e. all words are unique);  there is a way to put all words of the final set of words in the order so that the final sequence of $n$ words is consistent with the game rules. \n\nPolycarp wants to reverse minimal number of words. Please, help him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 the number of words in the Polycarp's set. Next $n$ lines contain these words. All of $n$ words aren't empty and contains only characters '0' and '1'. The sum of word lengths doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$. All words are different.\n\nGuaranteed, that the sum of $n$ for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $2\\cdot10^5$. Also, guaranteed that the sum of word lengths for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint answer for all of $t$ test cases in the order they appear.\n\nIf there is no answer for the test case, print -1. Otherwise, the first line of the output should contain $k$ ($0 \\le k \\le n$) \u2014 the minimal number of words in the set which should be reversed. The second line of the output should contain $k$ distinct integers \u2014 the indexes of the words in the set which should be reversed. Words are numerated from $1$ to $n$ in the order they appear. If $k=0$ you can skip this line (or you can print an empty line). If there are many answers you can print any of them.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n4\n0001\n1000\n0011\n0111\n3\n010\n101\n0\n2\n00000\n00001\n4\n01\n001\n0001\n00001\n\nOutput\n1\n3 \n-1\n0\n\n2\n1 2\n\n### RESPONSE:\n\nSTEP 1: GENERATE SUB-MODULES:\n```module \ndef count_start_end_chars(words):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function counts the number of words that start and end with each character.\n    Input:\n    words (list): A list of binary words.\n    Output:\n    start_count (defaultdict): A dictionary containing the count of words that start with each character.\n    end_count (defaultdict): A dictionary containing the count of words that end with each character.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n```module\ndef reverse_words(words, reversed_indices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function reverses the specified words in the given list.\n    Input:\n    words (list): A list of binary words.\n    reversed_indices (list): A list of indices indicating the words to be reversed.\n    Output:\n    reversed_words (list): A new list of words with the specified words reversed.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nSTEP 2: GENERATE PYTHON CODE\n```python \nimport collections\nfrom utils import *\n\ndef count_start_end_chars(words):\n    start_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        end_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        for word in words:\n            start_count[word[0]] += 1\n            end_count[word[-1]] += 1\n        return start_count, end_count\n\ndef reverse_words(words, reversed_indices):\n    reversed_words = []\n    for i, word in enumerate(words):\n        if i in reversed_indices:\n            reversed_words.append(word[::-1])\n        else:\n            reversed_words.append(word)\n    return reversed_words\n\ndef solve_task(words):\n    start_count, end_count = count_start_end_chars(words)\n\n    characters_with_difference = []\n    for char in start_count:\n        if abs(start_count[char] - end_count[char]) > 1:\n            characters_with_difference.append(char)\n\n    reversed_indices = []\n    for char in characters_with_difference:\n        difference = abs(start_count[char] - end_count[char])\n        reverse_count = difference // 2\n        if start_count[char] < end_count[char]:\n            indices = [i for i, word in enumerate(words) if word.startswith(char)]\n            reversed_indices.extend(indices[:reverse_count])\n        else:\n            indices = [i for i, word in enumerate(words) if word.endswith(char)]\n            reversed_indices.extend(indices[:reverse_count])\n\n    reversed_words = reverse_words(words, reversed_indices)\n\n    total_reversed = len(reversed_indices)\n    return total_reversed, reversed_words\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    words = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        words.append(input())\n    total_reversed, reversed_words = solve_task(words)\n    print(total_reversed)\n    if total_reversed != 0:\n        print(*reversed_words)\n```\n\n-----------------\n\n### Example 2\n### TASK:\nPolycarp analyzes the prices of the new berPhone.

If there are many answers you can print any of them.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n4\n0001\n1000\n0011\n0111\n3\n010\n101\n0\n2\n00000\n00001\n4\n01\n001\n0001\n00001\n\nOutput\n1\n3 \n-1\n0\n\n2\n1 2\n\n### RESPONSE:\n\nSTEP 1: GENERATE SUB-MODULES:\n```module \ndef count_start_end_chars(words):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function counts the number of words that start and end with each character.\n    Input:\n    words (list): A list of binary words.\n    Output:\n    start_count (defaultdict): A dictionary containing the count of words that start with each character.\n    end_count (defaultdict): A dictionary containing the count of words that end with each character.\n    \"\"\"", "```python\ndef count_bad_days(prices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function counts the number of bad days in a list of prices.\n    Input:\n    prices (list): A list of prices for n days.\n    Output:\n    count (int): The number of bad days.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(prices)\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if prices[i] < prices[i-1]:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef process_data_set(prices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function processes a single data set.\n    Input:\n    prices (list): A list of prices for n days.\n    Output:\n    bad_days (int): The number of bad days in the data set.\n    \"\"\"\n    return count_bad_days(prices)\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    bad_days = process_data_set(prices)\n    print(bad_days)\n```\n\n-----------------\n\n### Example 3\n### TASK:\nPolycarp has a set of $n$ integers. He wants to reverse the order of the integers in the set so that the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive integers is minimized.\n\nThe absolute difference between two integers is the greater of the absolute value of their difference or zero. For example, the absolute difference between 5 and 7 is 2, and the absolute difference between 1 and 1 is 0.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the number of integers in the set. The next line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$, where $a_i$ is the $i$-th integer in the set.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ for all test cases in the input does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the answer for all of $t$ test cases in the order they appear.\n\nIf there is no answer for the test case, print -1. Otherwise, print the list of integers in the order they should be reversed.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n5\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n3\n1 2 3 2 1\n\nOutput\n[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n[3, 2, 1, 2, 3]\n``` \n\n### RESPONSE:\n```python\ndef min_absolute_difference(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function calculates the minimum absolute difference between consecutive integers in a list.\n    Input:\n    numbers (list): A list of integers.\n    Output:\n    min_diff (int): The minimum absolute difference between consecutive integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(numbers)\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        diff = abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i+1])\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n    return min_diff\n\ndef reverse_list(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function reverses the list of integers.\n    Input:\n    numbers (list): A list of integers.\n    Output:\n    reversed_numbers (list): The list of integers in reverse order.\n    \"\"\"\n    return numbers[::-1]\n\ndef solve_task(numbers):\n    min_diff = min_absolute_difference(numbers)\n    if min_diff == 0:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return reverse_list(numbers)\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    result = solve_task(numbers)\n    if result == -1:\n        print(result)\n    else:\n        print(*result)\n``` "]}
