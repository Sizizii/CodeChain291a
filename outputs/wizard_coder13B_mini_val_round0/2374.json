For example, these words are binary: \"0001\", \"11\", \"0\" and \"0011100\".\n\nPolycarp wants to offer his set of $n$ binary words to play a game \"words\". In this game, players name words and each next word (starting from the second) must start with the last character of the previous word. The first word can be any. For example, these sequence of words can be named during the game: \"0101\", \"1\", \"10\", \"00\", \"00001\".\n\nWord reversal is the operation of reversing the order of the characters. For example, the word \"0111\" after the reversal becomes \"1110\", the word \"11010\" after the reversal becomes \"01011\".\n\nProbably, Polycarp has such a set of words that there is no way to put them in the order correspondent to the game rules. In this situation, he wants to reverse some words from his set so that:  the final set of $n$ words still contains different words (i.e. all words are unique);  there is a way to put all words of the final set of words in the order so that the final sequence of $n$ words is consistent with the game rules. \n\nPolycarp wants to reverse minimal number of words. Please, help him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 the number of words in the Polycarp's set. Next $n$ lines contain these words. All of $n$ words aren't empty and contains only characters '0' and '1'. The sum of word lengths doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$. All words are different.\n\nGuaranteed, that the sum of $n$ for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $2\\cdot10^5$. Also, guaranteed that the sum of word lengths for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint answer for all of $t$ test cases in the order they appear.\n\nIf there is no answer for the test case, print -1. Otherwise, the first line of the output should contain $k$ ($0 \\le k \\le n$) \u2014 the minimal number of words in the set which should be reversed. The second line of the output should contain $k$ distinct integers \u2014 the indexes of the words in the set which should be reversed. Words are numerated from $1$ to $n$ in the order they appear. If $k=0$ you can skip this line (or you can print an empty line). If there are many answers you can print any of them.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n4\n0001\n1000\n0011\n0111\n3\n010\n101\n0\n2\n00000\n00001\n4\n01\n001\n0001\n00001\n\nOutput\n1\n3 \n-1\n0\n\n2\n1 2\n\n### RESPONSE:\n\nSTEP 1: GENERATE SUB-MODULES:\n```module \ndef count_start_end_chars(words):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function counts the number of words that start and end with each character.\n    Input:\n    words (list): A list of binary words.\n    Output:\n    start_count (defaultdict): A dictionary containing the count of words that start with each character.\n    end_count (defaultdict): A dictionary containing the count of words that end with each character.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n```module\ndef reverse_words(words, reversed_indices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function reverses the specified words in the given list.\n    Input:\n    words (list): A list of binary words.\n    reversed_indices (list): A list of indices indicating the words to be reversed.\n    Output:\n    reversed_words (list): A new list of words with the specified words reversed.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nSTEP 2: GENERATE PYTHON CODE\n```python \nimport collections\nfrom utils import *\n\ndef count_start_end_chars(words):\n    start_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        end_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        for word in words:\n            start_count[word[0]] += 1\n            end_count[word[-1]] += 1\n        return start_count, end_count\n\ndef reverse_words(words, reversed_indices):\n    reversed_words = []\n    for i, word in enumerate(words):\n        if i in reversed_indices:\n            reversed_words.append(word[::-1])\n        else:\n            reversed_words.append(word)\n    return reversed_words\n\ndef solve_task(words):\n    start_count, end_count = count_start_end_chars(words)\n\n    characters_with_difference = []\n    for char in start_count:\n        if abs(start_count[char] - end_count[char]) > 1:\n            characters_with_difference.append(char)\n\n    reversed_indices = []\n    for char in characters_with_difference:\n        difference = abs(start_count[char] - end_count[char])\n        reverse_count = difference // 2\n        if start_count[char] < end_count[char]:\n            indices = [i for i, word in enumerate(words) if word.startswith(char)]\n            reversed_indices.extend(indices[:reverse_count])\n        else:\n            indices = [i for i, word in enumerate(words) if word.endswith(char)]\n            reversed_indices.extend(indices[:reverse_count])\n\n    reversed_words = reverse_words(words, reversed_indices)\n\n    total_reversed = len(reversed_indices)\n    return total_reversed, reversed_words\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    words = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        words.append(input())\n    total_reversed, reversed_words = solve_task(words)\n    print(total_reversed)\n    if total_reversed != 0:\n        print(*reversed_words)\n```\n\n-----------------\n\n### Example 2\n### TASK:\nYou are given a system of pipes. It consists of two rows, each row consists of $n$ pipes. The top left pipe has the coordinates $(1, 1)$ and the bottom right \u2014 $(2, n)$.\n\nThere are six types of pipes: two types of straight pipes and four types of curved pipes. Here are the examples of all six types:\n\n [Image] Types of pipes \n\nYou can turn each of the given pipes $90$ degrees clockwise or counterclockwise arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times (so the types $1$ and $2$ can become each other and types $3, 4, 5, 6$ can become each other).\n\nYou want to turn some pipes in a way that the water flow can start at $(1, 0)$ (to the left of the top left pipe), move to the pipe at $(1, 1)$, flow somehow by connected pipes to the pipe at $(2, n)$ and flow right to $(2, n + 1)$.\n\nPipes are connected if they are adjacent in the system and their ends are connected. Here are examples of connected pipes:\n\n [Image] Examples of connected pipes \n\nLet's describe the problem using some example:\n\n [Image] The first example input \n\nAnd its solution is below:  [Image] The first example answer \n\nAs you can see, the water flow is the poorly drawn blue line. To obtain the answer, we need to turn the pipe at $(1, 2)$ $90$ degrees clockwise, the pipe at $(2, 3)$ $90$ degrees, the pipe at $(1, 6)$ $90$ degrees, the pipe at $(1, 7)$ $180$ degrees and the pipe at $(2, 7)$ $180$ degrees. Then the flow of water can reach $(2, n + 1)$ from $(1, 0)$.\n\nYou have to answer $q$ independent queries.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of queries. Then $q$ queries follow.\n\nEach query consists of exactly three lines. The first line of the query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of pipes in each row. The next two lines contain a description of the first and the second rows correspondingly. Each row description consists of $n$ digits from $1$ to $6$ without any whitespaces between them, each digit corresponds to the type of pipe in the corresponding cell. See the problem statement to understand which digits correspond to which types of pipes.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all queries does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor the $i$-th query print the answer for it \u2014 \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to turn some pipes in a way that the water flow can reach $(2, n + 1)$ from $(1, 0)$, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n7\n2323216\n1615124\n1\n3\n4\n2\n13\n24\n2\n12\n34\n3\n536\n345\n2\n46\n54\n\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first query from the example is described in the problem statement.\n\n\n\n### RESPONSE:\n", "output": ["\nSTEP 1: GENERATE SUB-MODULES:\n```module \ndef count_pipes(pipes):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function counts the number of pipes of each type in the given list.\n    Input:\n    pipes (list): A list of pipes.\n    Output:\n    pipe_count (defaultdict): A dictionary containing the count of pipes of each type.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n```module \ndef build_system(pipes1, pipes2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function builds the system of pipes based on the given input.\n    Input:\n    pipes1 (list): A list of pipes in the first row.\n    pipes2 (list): A list of pipes in the second row.\n    Output:\n    system (list): A list of lists representing the system of pipes.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n```module \ndef check_pipes(system):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function checks if the system of pipes is valid.\n    Input:\n    system (list): A list of lists representing the system of pipes.\n    Output:\n    valid (bool): True if the system is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n```module \ndef count_flow(system):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function counts the number of connected pipes in the system.\n    Input:\n    system (list): A list of lists representing the system of pipes.\n    Output:\n    flow_count (int): The number of connected pipes in the system.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n```module \ndef find_flow(system):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function finds the path of connected pipes in the system.\n    Input:\n    system (list): A list of lists representing the system of pipes.\n    Output:\n    flow (list): A list of tuples representing the path of connected pipes in the system.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n```module \ndef reverse_pipes(pipes, reversed_indices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function reverses the specified pipes in the given list.\n    Input:\n    pipes (list): A list of pipes.\n    reversed_indices (list): A list of indices indicating the pipes to be reversed.\n    Output:\n    reversed_pipes (list): A new list of pipes with the specified pipes reversed.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n```module \ndef solve_task(pipes1, pipes2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function solves the task by counting the number of connected pipes, finding the path of connected pipes, and checking if there is a way to reach the desired point.\n    Input:\n    pipes1 (list): A list of pipes in the first row.\n    pipes2 (list): A list of pipes in the second row.\n    Output:\n    answer (str): \"YES\" if it is possible to reach the desired point, \"NO\" otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nSTEP 2: GENERATE PYTHON CODE\n```python\nimport collections\nfrom utils import *\n\ndef count_pipes(pipes):\n    pipe_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    for pipe in pipes:\n        pipe_count[pipe] += 1\n    return pipe_count\n\ndef build_system(pipes1, pipes2):\n    system = []\n    for i in range(len(pipes1)):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(len(pipes2)):\n            if i == j:\n                row.append(pipes1[i] + pipes2[j])\n            else:\n                row.append(\"\")\n        system.append(row)\n    return system\n\ndef check_pipes(system):\n    for row in system:\n        if \"\" in row:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef count_flow(system):\n    flow_count = 0\n    for i in range(len(system)):\n        for j in range(len(system[0])):\n            if system[i][j] != \"\":\n                flow_count += 1\n    return flow_count\n\ndef find_flow(system):\n    flow = []\n    visited = set()\n    for i in range(len(system)):\n        for j in range(len(system[0])):\n            if (i, j) not in visited and system[i][j] != \"\":\n                path = []\n                find_path(system, i, j, visited, path)\n                if len(path) > 0:\n                    flow.append(path)\n    return flow\n\ndef find_path(system, i, j, visited, path):\n    if (i, j) in visited:\n        return\n    visited.add((i, j))\n    path.append((i, j))\n    if i > 0 and system[i -

The operation can be performed any number of times.\n\nYou need to find the minimum number of operations required to obtain the target value $t$ from the given set.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$), the number of integers in the set. \nThe next line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), the integers in the set.\nThe last line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^9$), the target value.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint the minimum number of operations required to obtain the target value $t$ from the given set.\n\n-----Example 1-----\nInput\n4\n1 2 3 4 5\n9\n\nOutput\n2\n\nExplanation: We can replace 3 with 6 and then 4 with 12 to obtain 9.\n\n-----Example 2-----\nInput\n5\n2 3 5 7 11 13\n20\n\nOutput\n1\n\nExplanation: We can replace 11 with 33 to obtain 20.\n\n-----Example 3-----\nInput\n4\n1 2 3 4 5\n7\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nExplanation: It is not possible to obtain 7 from the given set using the operations.\n\n### RESPONSE:The problem can be solved using binary search. We start by assuming that we can obtain $t$ using $0$ operations. Then, we try to increase the number of operations by replacing an integer with $2$ or $3$ times the original integer until we either reach $t$ or exceed it.\n\nIf we reach $t$ without exceeding it, we return the number of operations. Otherwise, we try to decrease the number of operations by replacing an integer with $2$ or $3$ times the original integer until we are able to obtain $t$. We return -1 if we are not able to obtain $t$ using any number of operations.\n\n```python\ndef min_operations(numbers, target):\n    n"]}
