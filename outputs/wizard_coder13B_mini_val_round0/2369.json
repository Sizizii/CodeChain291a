For example, these words are binary: \"0001\", \"11\", \"0\" and \"0011100\".\n\nPolycarp wants to offer his set of $n$ binary words to play a game \"words\". In this game, players name words and each next word (starting from the second) must start with the last character of the previous word. The first word can be any. For example, these sequence of words can be named during the game: \"0101\", \"1\", \"10\", \"00\", \"00001\".\n\nWord reversal is the operation of reversing the order of the characters. For example, the word \"0111\" after the reversal becomes \"1110\", the word \"11010\" after the reversal becomes \"01011\".\n\nProbably, Polycarp has such a set of words that there is no way to put them in the order correspondent to the game rules. In this situation, he wants to reverse some words from his set so that:  the final set of $n$ words still contains different words (i.e. all words are unique);  there is a way to put all words of the final set of words in the order so that the final sequence of $n$ words is consistent with the game rules. \n\nPolycarp wants to reverse minimal number of words. Please, help him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 the number of words in the Polycarp's set. Next $n$ lines contain these words. All of $n$ words aren't empty and contains only characters '0' and '1'. The sum of word lengths doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$. All words are different.\n\nGuaranteed, that the sum of $n$ for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $2\\cdot10^5$. Also, guaranteed that the sum of word lengths for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint answer for all of $t$ test cases in the order they appear.\n\nIf there is no answer for the test case, print -1. Otherwise, the first line of the output should contain $k$ ($0 \\le k \\le n$) \u2014 the minimal number of words in the set which should be reversed. The second line of the output should contain $k$ distinct integers \u2014 the indexes of the words in the set which should be reversed. Words are numerated from $1$ to $n$ in the order they appear.

The type of the $i$-th candy is $a_i$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$). \n\nYou have to prepare a gift using some of these candies with the following restriction: the numbers of candies of each type presented in a gift should be all distinct (i. e. for example, a gift having two candies of type $1$ and two candies of type $2$ is bad).\n\nIt is possible that multiple types of candies are completely absent from the gift. It is also possible that not all candies of some types will be taken to a gift.\n\nYou really like some of the candies and don't want to include them into the gift, but you want to eat them yourself instead. For each candy, a number $f_i$ is given, which is equal to $0$ if you really want to keep $i$-th candy for yourself, or $1$ if you don't mind including it into your gift. It is possible that two candies of the same type have different values of $f_i$.\n\nYou want your gift to be as large as possible, but you don't want to include too many of the candies you want to eat into the gift. So, you want to calculate the maximum possible number of candies that can be included into a gift, and among all ways to choose maximum number of candies, you want to maximize the number of candies having $f_i = 1$ in your gift.\n\nYou have to answer $q$ independent queries.\n\nIf you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nThe first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of candies.\n\nThen $n$ lines follow, each containing two integers $a_i$ and $f_i$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$, $0 \\le f_i \\le 1$), where $a_i$ is the type of the $i$-th candy, and $f_i$ denotes whether you want to keep the $i$-th candy for yourself ($0$ if you want to keep it, $1$ if you don't mind giving it away).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all queries does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each query print two integers:\n\n  the maximum number of candies in a gift you can compose, according to the constraints in the statement;  the maximum number of candies having $f_i = 1$ in a gift you can compose that contains the maximum possible number of candies.  \n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n8\n1 0\n4 1\n2 0\n4 1\n5 1\n6 1\n3 0\n2 0\n4\n1 1\n1 1\n2 1\n2 1\n9\n2 0\n2 0\n4 1\n4 1\n4 1\n7 0\n7 1\n7 0\n7 1\n\nOutput\n3 3\n3 3\n9 5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first query, you can include two candies of type $4$ and one candy of type $5$.

If there are many answers you can print any of them.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n4\n0001\n1000\n0011\n0111\n3\n010\n101\n0\n2\n0000\n00001\n4\n01\n001\n0001\n00001\n\nOutput\n1\n3 \n-1\n0\n\n2\n1 2\n```\n\n### RESPONSE:\n```python\ndef count_start_end_chars(words):\n    start_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    end_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    for word in words:\n        start_count[word[0]] += 1\n        end_count[word[-1]] += 1\n    return start_count, end_count\n\ndef reverse_words(words, reversed_indices):\n    reversed_words = []\n    for i, word in enumerate(words):\n        if i in reversed_indices", "```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    for _ in range(n):\n        q = int(input())\n        types = defaultdict(int)\n        for _ in range(q):\n            a, f = map(int, input().split())\n            types[a] += 1\n\n        max_candies = 0\n        max_f = 0\n        for c in types:\n            if f == 0:\n                max_candies += types[c]\n            else:\n                max_f += types[c]\n\n        print(max_candies, max_f)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nSTEP 1: GENERATE SUB-MODULES:\n```module \ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: Main function to solve the problem.\n    Input:\n    None\n    Output:\n    None\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nSTEP 2: GENERATE PYTHON CODE\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    for _ in range(n):\n        q = int(input())\n        types = defaultdict(int)\n        for _ in range(q):\n            a, f = map(int, input().split())\n            types[a] += 1\n\n        max_candies = 0\n        max_f = 0\n        for c in types:\n            if f == 0:\n                max_candies += types[c]\n            else:\n                max_f += types[c]\n\n        print(max_candies, max_f)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n``` ", "\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef count_candies(candies):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function counts the number of candies of each type.\n    Input:\n    candies (list): A list of tuples (type, f_i)\n    Output:\n    type_count (defaultdict): A dictionary containing the count of candies of each type.\n    \"\"\"\n    type_count = defaultdict(int)\n    for candy_type, f_i in candies:\n        type_count[candy_type] += 1\n    return type_count\n\ndef calculate_gift(candies):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function calculates the maximum possible number of candies in a gift.\n    Input:\n    candies (list): A list of tuples (type, f_i)\n    Output:\n    max_candies (int): The maximum number of candies in a gift.\n    \"\"\"\n    type_count = count_candies(candies)\n    max_candies = sum(type_count.values())\n    return max_candies\n\ndef calculate_gift_with_f_i(candies):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function calculates the maximum possible number of candies in a gift, while maximizing the number of candies with f_i = 1.\n    Input:\n    candies (list): A list of tuples (type, f_i)\n    Output:\n    max_candies (int): The maximum number of candies in a gift.\n    max_f_i (int): The maximum number of candies with f_i = 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    type_count = count_candies(candies)\n    max_candies = sum(type_count.values())\n    max_f_i = sum(type_count[i] for i, f_i in candies if f_i == 1)\n    return max_candies, max_f_i\n\ndef main():\n    q = int(input())\n    for _ in range(q):\n        n = int(input())\n        candies = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            a_i, f_i = map(int, input().split())\n            candies.append((a_i, f_i))\n        max_candies, max_f_i = calculate_gift_with_f_i(candies)\n        print(max_candies, max_f_i)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef count_candies(candies):\n    type_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    for candy_type, f_i in candies:\n        type_count[candy_type] += 1\n    return type_count\n\ndef calculate_gift(candies):\n    type_count = count_candies(candies)\n    max_candies = sum(type_count.values())\n    return max_candies\n\ndef calculate_gift_with_f_i(candies):\n    type_count = count_candies(candies)\n    max_candies = sum(type_count.values())\n    max_f_i = sum(type_count[i] for i, f_i in candies if f_i == 1)\n    return max_candies, max_f_i\n\ndef main():\n    q = int(input())\n    for _ in range(q):\n        n = int(input())\n        candies = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            a_i, f_i = map(int, input().split())\n            candies.append((a_i, f_i))\n        max_candies, max_f_i = calculate_gift_with_f_i(candies)\n        print(max_candies, max_f_i)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n``` "]}
