{"prompt": "Below is a competitive programming question. Read the question carefully.\n\n*Instruction*\nDevelop a well-structured Python solution for the provided problem that obeys the constraints and passes the example test cases. Ensure modularity and considering potential edge cases and failures. Start by outlining the required code modules, including function headers and signatures. Subsequently, proceed to implement each module to create the final code.\n\nIn simpler terms, create a clean and organized Python solution for the given problem. Break it down into smaller parts (modules) with clear function names and input/output specifications. Once the structure is ready, write the actual code for each module to complete the solution.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO. Please wrap your code answer using ```.\n\n### Example 1\n### TASK:\nPolycarp has $n$ different binary words. A word called binary if it contains only characters '0' and '1'. For example, these words are binary: \"0001\", \"11\", \"0\" and \"0011100\".\n\nPolycarp wants to offer his set of $n$ binary words to play a game \"words\". In this game, players name words and each next word (starting from the second) must start with the last character of the previous word. The first word can be any. For example, these sequence of words can be named during the game: \"0101\", \"1\", \"10\", \"00\", \"00001\".\n\nWord reversal is the operation of reversing the order of the characters. For example, the word \"0111\" after the reversal becomes \"1110\", the word \"11010\" after the reversal becomes \"01011\".\n\nProbably, Polycarp has such a set of words that there is no way to put them in the order correspondent to the game rules. In this situation, he wants to reverse some words from his set so that:  the final set of $n$ words still contains different words (i.e. all words are unique);  there is a way to put all words of the final set of words in the order so that the final sequence of $n$ words is consistent with the game rules. \n\nPolycarp wants to reverse minimal number of words. Please, help him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 the number of words in the Polycarp's set. Next $n$ lines contain these words. All of $n$ words aren't empty and contains only characters '0' and '1'. The sum of word lengths doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$. All words are different.\n\nGuaranteed, that the sum of $n$ for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $2\\cdot10^5$. Also, guaranteed that the sum of word lengths for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint answer for all of $t$ test cases in the order they appear.\n\nIf there is no answer for the test case, print -1. Otherwise, the first line of the output should contain $k$ ($0 \\le k \\le n$) \u2014 the minimal number of words in the set which should be reversed. The second line of the output should contain $k$ distinct integers \u2014 the indexes of the words in the set which should be reversed. Words are numerated from $1$ to $n$ in the order they appear. If $k=0$ you can skip this line (or you can print an empty line). If there are many answers you can print any of them.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n4\n0001\n1000\n0011\n0111\n3\n010\n101\n0\n2\n00000\n00001\n4\n01\n001\n0001\n00001\n\nOutput\n1\n3 \n-1\n0\n\n2\n1 2\n\n### RESPONSE:\n\nSTEP 1: GENERATE SUB-MODULES:\n```module \ndef count_start_end_chars(words):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function counts the number of words that start and end with each character.\n    Input:\n    words (list): A list of binary words.\n    Output:\n    start_count (defaultdict): A dictionary containing the count of words that start with each character.\n    end_count (defaultdict): A dictionary containing the count of words that end with each character.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n```module\ndef reverse_words(words, reversed_indices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function reverses the specified words in the given list.\n    Input:\n    words (list): A list of binary words.\n    reversed_indices (list): A list of indices indicating the words to be reversed.\n    Output:\n    reversed_words (list): A new list of words with the specified words reversed.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nSTEP 2: GENERATE PYTHON CODE\n```python \nimport collections\nfrom utils import *\n\ndef count_start_end_chars(words):\n    start_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        end_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        for word in words:\n            start_count[word[0]] += 1\n            end_count[word[-1]] += 1\n        return start_count, end_count\n\ndef reverse_words(words, reversed_indices):\n    reversed_words = []\n    for i, word in enumerate(words):\n        if i in reversed_indices:\n            reversed_words.append(word[::-1])\n        else:\n            reversed_words.append(word)\n    return reversed_words\n\ndef solve_task(words):\n    start_count, end_count = count_start_end_chars(words)\n\n    characters_with_difference = []\n    for char in start_count:\n        if abs(start_count[char] - end_count[char]) > 1:\n            characters_with_difference.append(char)\n\n    reversed_indices = []\n    for char in characters_with_difference:\n        difference = abs(start_count[char] - end_count[char])\n        reverse_count = difference // 2\n        if start_count[char] < end_count[char]:\n            indices = [i for i, word in enumerate(words) if word.startswith(char)]\n            reversed_indices.extend(indices[:reverse_count])\n        else:\n            indices = [i for i, word in enumerate(words) if word.endswith(char)]\n            reversed_indices.extend(indices[:reverse_count])\n\n    reversed_words = reverse_words(words, reversed_indices)\n\n    total_reversed = len(reversed_indices)\n    return total_reversed, reversed_words\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    words = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        words.append(input())\n    total_reversed, reversed_words = solve_task(words)\n    print(total_reversed)\n    if total_reversed != 0:\n        print(*reversed_words)\n```\n\n-----------------\n\n### Example 2\n### TASK:\nYou are given an undirected unweighted graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges (which represents the map of Bertown) and the array of prices $p$ of length $m$. It is guaranteed that there is a path between each pair of vertices (districts).\n\nMike has planned a trip from the vertex (district) $a$ to the vertex (district) $b$ and then from the vertex (district) $b$ to the vertex (district) $c$. He can visit the same district twice or more. But there is one issue: authorities of the city want to set a price for using the road so if someone goes along the road then he should pay the price corresponding to this road (he pays each time he goes along the road). The list of prices that will be used $p$ is ready and they just want to distribute it between all roads in the town in such a way that each price from the array corresponds to exactly one road.\n\nYou are a good friend of Mike (and suddenly a mayor of Bertown) and want to help him to make his trip as cheap as possible. So, your task is to distribute prices between roads in such a way that if Mike chooses the optimal path then the price of the trip is the minimum possible. Note that you cannot rearrange prices after the start of the trip.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases.

There are no loops or multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair ($v_i, u_i$) there are no other pairs ($v_i, u_i$) or ($u_i, v_i$) in the array of edges, and for each pair $(v_i, u_i)$ the condition $v_i \\ne u_i$ is satisfied. It is guaranteed that the given graph is connected.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ (as well as the sum of $m$) does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$ ($\\sum n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $\\sum m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer \u2014 the minimum possible price of Mike's trip if you distribute prices between edges optimally.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n4 3 2 3 4\n1 2 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n7 9 1 5 7\n2 10 4 8 5 6 7 3 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n3 2\n3 5\n4 2\n5 6\n1 7\n6 7\n\nOutput\n7\n12\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nOne of the possible solution to the first test case of the example:\n\n[Image]\n\nOne of the possible solution to the second test case of the example:\n\n[Image]\n\n\n\n### RESPONSE:\n", "output": ["\nSTEP 1: GENERATE SUB-MODULES:\n```python\ndef read_test_case(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function reads the input for a test case.\n    Input:\n    n (int): The number of vertices.\n    m (int): The number of edges.\n    Output:\n    graph (list): A list of lists representing the graph.\n    prices (list): A list of prices.\n    a (int): The starting vertex.\n    b (int): The intermediate vertex.\n    c (int): The final vertex.\n    \"\"\"\n    graph = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        graph.append(list(map(int, input().split()))[1:])\n    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    a, b, c = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    return graph, prices, a, b, c\n\ndef find_path(graph, a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function finds a path between two vertices using DFS.\n    Input:\n    graph (list): A list of lists representing the graph.\n    a (int): The starting vertex.\n    b (int): The final vertex.\n    Output:\n    path (list): A list of vertices in the path from a to b.\n    \"\"\"\n    visited = [False] * len(graph)\n    stack = [a]\n    path = []\n\n    while stack:\n        current = stack[-1]\n        if current == b:\n            path.append(current)\n            return path\n        for neighbor in graph[current]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                visited[neighbor] = True\n                stack.append(neighbor)\n                break\n        else:\n            path.append(current)\n            stack.pop()\n\n    return None\n```\n\n```python\ndef find_min_price(graph, prices, a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function finds the minimum price for Mike's trip.\n    Input:\n    graph (list): A list of lists representing the graph.\n    prices (list): A list of prices.\n    a (int): The starting vertex.\n    b (int): The intermediate vertex.\n    c (int): The final vertex.\n    Output:\n    min_price (int): The minimum possible price of Mike's trip.\n    \"\"\"\n    path_ab = find_path(graph, a, b)\n    path_bc = find_path(graph, b, c)\n\n    if path_ab is None or path_bc is None:\n        return -1\n\n    min_price = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(path_ab)):\n        for j in range(len(path_bc)):\n            if path_ab[i] == path_bc[-1 -
