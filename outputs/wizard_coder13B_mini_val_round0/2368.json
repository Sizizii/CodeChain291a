For example, these words are binary: \"0001\", \"11\", \"0\" and \"0011100\".\n\nPolycarp wants to offer his set of $n$ binary words to play a game \"words\". In this game, players name words and each next word (starting from the second) must start with the last character of the previous word. The first word can be any. For example, these sequence of words can be named during the game: \"0101\", \"1\", \"10\", \"00\", \"00001\".\n\nWord reversal is the operation of reversing the order of the characters. For example, the word \"0111\" after the reversal becomes \"1110\", the word \"11010\" after the reversal becomes \"01011\".\n\nProbably, Polycarp has such a set of words that there is no way to put them in the order correspondent to the game rules. In this situation, he wants to reverse some words from his set so that:  the final set of $n$ words still contains different words (i.e. all words are unique);  there is a way to put all words of the final set of words in the order so that the final sequence of $n$ words is consistent with the game rules. \n\nPolycarp wants to reverse minimal number of words. Please, help him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 the number of words in the Polycarp's set. Next $n$ lines contain these words. All of $n$ words aren't empty and contains only characters '0' and '1'. The sum of word lengths doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$. All words are different.\n\nGuaranteed, that the sum of $n$ for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $2\\cdot10^5$. Also, guaranteed that the sum of word lengths for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint answer for all of $t$ test cases in the order they appear.\n\nIf there is no answer for the test case, print -1. Otherwise, the first line of the output should contain $k$ ($0 \\le k \\le n$) \u2014 the minimal number of words in the set which should be reversed. The second line of the output should contain $k$ distinct integers \u2014 the indexes of the words in the set which should be reversed. Words are numerated from $1$ to $n$ in the order they appear. If $k=0$ you can skip this line (or you can print an empty line). If there are many answers you can print any of them.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n4\n0001\n1000\n0011\n0111\n3\n010\n101\n0\n2\n00000\n00001\n4\n01\n001\n0001\n00001\n\nOutput\n1\n3 \n-1\n0\n\n2\n1 2\n\n### RESPONSE:\n\nSTEP 1: GENERATE SUB-MODULES:\n```module \ndef count_start_end_chars(words):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function counts the number of words that start and end with each character.\n    Input:\n    words (list): A list of binary words.\n    Output:\n    start_count (defaultdict): A dictionary containing the count of words that start with each character.\n    end_count (defaultdict): A dictionary containing the count of words that end with each character.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n```module\ndef reverse_words(words, reversed_indices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function reverses the specified words in the given list.\n    Input:\n    words (list): A list of binary words.\n    reversed_indices (list): A list of indices indicating the words to be reversed.\n    Output:\n    reversed_words (list): A new list of words with the specified words reversed.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nSTEP 2: GENERATE PYTHON CODE\n```python \nimport collections\nfrom utils import *\n\ndef count_start_end_chars(words):\n    start_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        end_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        for word in words:\n            start_count[word[0]] += 1\n            end_count[word[-1]] += 1\n        return start_count, end_count\n\ndef reverse_words(words, reversed_indices):\n    reversed_words = []\n    for i, word in enumerate(words):\n        if i in reversed_indices:\n            reversed_words.append(word[::-1])\n        else:\n            reversed_words.append(word)\n    return reversed_words\n\ndef solve_task(words):\n    start_count, end_count = count_start_end_chars(words)\n\n    characters_with_difference = []\n    for char in start_count:\n        if abs(start_count[char] - end_count[char]) > 1:\n            characters_with_difference.append(char)\n\n    reversed_indices = []\n    for char in characters_with_difference:\n        difference = abs(start_count[char] - end_count[char])\n        reverse_count = difference // 2\n        if start_count[char] < end_count[char]:\n            indices = [i for i, word in enumerate(words) if word.startswith(char)]\n            reversed_indices.extend(indices[:reverse_count])\n        else:\n            indices = [i for i, word in enumerate(words) if word.endswith(char)]\n            reversed_indices.extend(indices[:reverse_count])\n\n    reversed_words = reverse_words(words, reversed_indices)\n\n    total_reversed = len(reversed_indices)\n    return total_reversed, reversed_words\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    words = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        words.append(input())\n    total_reversed, reversed_words = solve_task(words)\n    print(total_reversed)\n    if total_reversed != 0:\n        print(*reversed_words)\n```\n\n-----------------\n\n### Example 2\n### TASK:\nYou have $n$ gifts and you want to give all of them to children.

If there are many answers you can print any of them.\n\n### Example\nInput\n4\n4\n0001\n1000\n0011\n0111\n3\n010\n101\n0\n2\n0000\n00001\n4\n01\n001\n0001\n00001\n\nOutput\n1\n3 \n-1\n0", "\n```python\ndef equalize_candies(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: Calculates the minimum number of moves required to equalize all the candies.\n    Input:\n    a (list): List of the number of candies in each gift.\n    b (list): List of the number of oranges in each gift.\n    Output:\n    min_moves (int): The minimum number of moves required to equalize all the gifts.\n    \"\"\"\n    min_moves = 0\n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        min_moves += abs(a[i] - b[i])\n    return min_moves\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, input().split())\n    min_moves = equalize_candies(a, b)\n    print(min_moves)\n``` ", "\n```module\ndef solve_task(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function calculates the minimum number of moves required to equalize all the given gifts.\n    Input:\n    a (list): A list of candy counts for each gift.\n    b (list): A list of orange counts for each gift.\n    Output:\n    min_moves (int): The minimum number of moves required to equalize all the given gifts.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n```python\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    min_moves = solve_task(a, b)\n    print(min_moves)\n```\n\nSTEP 1: GENERATE SUB-MODULES:\n```module\ndef solve_task(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function calculates the minimum number of moves required to equalize all the given gifts.\n    Input:\n    a (list): A list of candy counts for each gift.\n    b (list): A list of orange counts for each gift.\n    Output:\n    min_moves (int): The minimum number of moves required to equalize all the given gifts.\n    \"\"\"\n    min_moves = 0\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        min_moves += min(abs(a[i] - a[0]), abs(b[i] - b[0]))\n    return min_moves\n```\n\nSTEP 2: GENERATE PYTHON CODE\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_task(a, b):\n    min_moves = 0\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        min_moves += min(abs(a[i] - a[0]), abs(b[i] - b[0]))\n    return min_moves\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    min_moves = solve_task(a, b)\n    print(min_moves)\n``` ", "```python\ndef count_candies_oranges(candies, oranges):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function counts the number of gifts that have more candies and more oranges.\n    Input:\n    candies (list): A list of candies in each gift.\n    oranges (list): A list of oranges in each gift.\n    Output:\n    more_candies (int): The number of gifts with more candies.\n    more_oranges (int): The number of gifts with more oranges.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n```python\ndef solve_task(candies, oranges):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function finds the minimum number of moves required to equalize all the given gifts.\n    Input:\n    candies (list): A list of candies in each gift.\n    oranges (list): A list of oranges in each gift.\n    Output:\n    min_moves (int): The minimum number of moves required to equalize all the given gifts.\n    \"\"\"\n    more_candies, more_oranges = count_candies_oranges(candies, oranges)\n\n    min_moves = 0\n    if more_candies > 0:\n        min_moves += more_candies\n    if more_oranges > 0:\n        min_moves += more_oranges\n\n    return min_moves\n\ndef count_candies_oranges(candies, oranges):\n    more_candies = 0\n    more_oranges = 0\n    for i in range(len(candies)):\n        if candies[i] > oranges[i]:\n            more_candies += candies[i] - oranges[i]\n        elif oranges[i] > candies[i]:\n            more_oranges += oranges[i] - candies[i]\n\n    return more_candies, more_oranges\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    candies = []\n    oranges = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        candy, orange = map(int, input().split())\n        candies.append(candy)\n        oranges.append(orange)\n    min_moves = solve_task(candies, oranges)\n    print(min_moves)\n```\n\n-----------------\n\n### Example 3\n### TASK:\nPolycarp has a set of $n$ binary words. A word called binary if it contains only characters '0' and '1'. For example, these words are binary: \"0001\", \"11\", \"0\" and \"0011100\". Polycarp wants to offer his set of $n$ binary words to play a game \"words\". In this game, players name words and each next word (starting from the second) must start with the last character of the previous word. The first word can be any. For example, these sequence of words can be named during the game: \"0101\", \"1\", \"10\", \"00\", \"00001\".\n\nWord reversal is the operation of reversing the order of the characters. For example, the word \"0111\" after the reversal becomes \"1110\", the word \"11010\" after the reversal becomes \"01011\".\n\nProbably, Polycarp has such a set of words that there is no way to put them in the order correspondent to the game rules. In this situation, he wants to reverse some words from his set so that:  the final set of $n$ words still contains different words (i.e. all words are unique);  there is a way to put all words of the final set of words in the order so that the final sequence of $n$ words is consistent with the game rules. \n\nPolycarp wants to reverse minimal number of words. Please, help him.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 the number of words in the Polycarp's set. Next $n$ lines contain these words. All of $n$ words aren't empty and contains only characters '0' and '1'. The sum of word lengths doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$. All words are different.\n\nGuaranteed, that the sum of $n$ for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $2\\cdot10^5$. Also, guaranteed that the sum of word lengths for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print the minimal number of words that should be reversed to satisfy the game rules. If there is no answer, print -1. If there are many answers, print any of them.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n4\n0001\n1000\n0011\n01"]}
