Please wrap your code answer using ```.\n\n### Example 1\n### TASK:\nPolycarp has $n$ different binary words. A word called binary if it contains only characters '0' and '1'. For example, these words are binary: \"0001\", \"11\", \"0\" and \"0011100\".\n\nPolycarp wants to offer his set of $n$ binary words to play a game \"words\". In this game, players name words and each next word (starting from the second) must start with the last character of the previous word. The first word can be any. For example, these sequence of words can be named during the game: \"0101\", \"1\", \"10\", \"00\", \"00001\".\n\nWord reversal is the operation of reversing the order of the characters. For example, the word \"0111\" after the reversal becomes \"1110\", the word \"11010\" after the reversal becomes \"01011\".\n\nProbably, Polycarp has such a set of words that there is no way to put them in the order correspondent to the game rules. In this situation, he wants to reverse some words from his set so that:  the final set of $n$ words still contains different words (i.e. all words are unique);  there is a way to put all words of the final set of words in the order so that the final sequence of $n$ words is consistent with the game rules. \n\nPolycarp wants to reverse minimal number of words. Please, help him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 the number of words in the Polycarp's set. Next $n$ lines contain these words. All of $n$ words aren't empty and contains only characters '0' and '1'. The sum of word lengths doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$. All words are different.\n\nGuaranteed, that the sum of $n$ for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $2\\cdot10^5$. Also, guaranteed that the sum of word lengths for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $4\\cdot10^6$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint answer for all of $t$ test cases in the order they appear.\n\nIf there is no answer for the test case, print -1. Otherwise, the first line of the output should contain $k$ ($0 \\le k \\le n$) \u2014 the minimal number of words in the set which should be reversed. The second line of the output should contain $k$ distinct integers \u2014 the indexes of the words in the set which should be reversed. Words are numerated from $1$ to $n$ in the order they appear. If $k=0$ you can skip this line (or you can print an empty line). If there are many answers you can print any of them.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n4\n0001\n1000\n0011\n0111\n3\n010\n101\n0\n2\n00000\n00001\n4\n01\n001\n0001\n00001\n\nOutput\n1\n3 \n-1\n0\n\n2\n1 2\n\n### RESPONSE:\n\nSTEP 1: GENERATE SUB-MODULES:\n```module \ndef count_start_end_chars(words):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function counts the number of words that start and end with each character.\n    Input:\n    words (list): A list of binary words.\n    Output:\n    start_count (defaultdict): A dictionary containing the count of words that start with each character.\n    end_count (defaultdict): A dictionary containing the count of words that end with each character.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n```module\ndef reverse_words(words, reversed_indices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function reverses the specified words in the given list.\n    Input:\n    words (list): A list of binary words.\n    reversed_indices (list): A list of indices indicating the words to be reversed.\n    Output:\n    reversed_words (list): A new list of words with the specified words reversed.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nSTEP 2: GENERATE PYTHON CODE\n```python \nimport collections\nfrom utils import *\n\ndef count_start_end_chars(words):\n    start_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        end_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        for word in words:\n            start_count[word[0]] += 1\n            end_count[word[-1]] += 1\n        return start_count, end_count\n\ndef reverse_words(words, reversed_indices):\n    reversed_words = []\n    for i, word in enumerate(words):\n        if i in reversed_indices:\n            reversed_words.append(word[::-1])\n        else:\n            reversed_words.append(word)\n    return reversed_words\n\ndef solve_task(words):\n    start_count, end_count = count_start_end_chars(words)\n\n    characters_with_difference = []\n    for char in start_count:\n        if abs(start_count[char] - end_count[char]) > 1:\n            characters_with_difference.append(char)\n\n    reversed_indices = []\n    for char in characters_with_difference:\n        difference = abs(start_count[char] - end_count[char])\n        reverse_count = difference // 2\n        if start_count[char] < end_count[char]:\n            indices = [i for i, word in enumerate(words) if word.startswith(char)]\n            reversed_indices.extend(indices[:reverse_count])\n        else:\n            indices = [i for i, word in enumerate(words) if word.endswith(char)]\n            reversed_indices.extend(indices[:reverse_count])\n\n    reversed_words = reverse_words(words, reversed_indices)\n\n    total_reversed = len(reversed_indices)\n    return total_reversed, reversed_words\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    words = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        words.append(input())\n    total_reversed, reversed_words = solve_task(words)\n    print(total_reversed)\n    if total_reversed != 0:\n        print(*reversed_words)\n```\n\n-----------------\n\n### Example 2\n### TASK:\nOh, New Year. The time to gather all your friends and reflect on the heartwarming events of the past year...\n\n$n$ friends live in a city which can be represented as a number line. The $i$-th friend lives in a house with an integer coordinate $x_i$. The $i$-th friend can come celebrate the New Year to the house with coordinate $x_i-1$, $x_i+1$ or stay at $x_i$. Each friend is allowed to move no more than once.\n\nFor all friends $1 \\le x_i \\le n$ holds, however, they can come to houses with coordinates $0$ and $n+1$ (if their houses are at $1$ or $n$, respectively).\n\nFor example, let the initial positions be $x = [1, 2, 4, 4]$. The final ones then can be $[1, 3, 3, 4]$, $[0, 2, 3, 3]$, $[2, 2, 5, 5]$, $[2, 1, 3, 5]$ and so on. The number of occupied houses is the number of distinct positions among the final ones.\n\nSo all friends choose the moves they want to perform. After that the number of occupied houses is calculated. What is the minimum and the maximum number of occupied houses can there be?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of friends.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ ($1 \\le x_i \\le n$) \u2014 the coordinates of the houses of the friends.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two integers \u2014 the minimum and the maximum possible number of occupied houses after all moves are performed.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 2 4 4\n\nOutput\n2 4\n\nInput\n9\n1 1 8 8 8 4 4 4 4\n\nOutput\n3 8\n\nInput\n7\n4 3 7 1 4 3 3\n\nOutput\n3 6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example friends can go to $[2, 2, 3, 3]$. So friend $1$ goes to $x_1+1$, friend $2$ stays at his house $x_2$, friend $3$ goes to $x_3-1$ and friend $4$ goes to $x_4-1$. $[1, 1, 3, 3]$, $[2, 2, 3, 3]$ or $[2, 2, 4, 4]$ are also all valid options to obtain $2$ occupied houses.\n\nFor the maximum number of occupied houses friends can go to $[1, 2, 3, 4]$ or to $[0, 2, 4, 5]$, for example.\n\n\n\n### RESPONSE:\n", "output": ["Here is a possible solution to the problem:\n\n```python\ndef count_occupied_houses(x, moves):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function calculates the number of occupied houses after all friends have made their moves.\n    Input:\n    x (list): A list of integers representing the original positions of the friends.\n    moves (list): A list of integers representing the moves made by each friend.\n    Output:\n    occupied_houses (list): The number of occupied houses after all moves are performed.\n    \"\"\"\n    occupied_houses = set(x)\n    for i in range(len(x)):\n        occupied_houses.add(x[i] + moves[i])\n    return len(occupied_houses)\n\ndef min_max_occupied_houses(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Description: This function calculates the minimum and maximum number of occupied houses possible after all friends have made their moves.\n    Input:\n    x (list): A list of integers representing the original positions of the friends.\n    Output:\n    min_occupied_houses, max_occupied_houses (int, int): The minimum and maximum number of occupied houses after all moves are performed.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(x)\n    min_occupied_houses = 0\n    max_occupied_houses = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            for move in [-1, 1]:\n                new_x = x[:i] + [x[j] + move] + x[i+1:]\n                new_occupied_houses = count_occupied_houses(new_x, [0] * i + [move] + [0] * (n-i-1))\n                min_occupied_houses = max(min_occupied_houses, new_occupied_houses)\n                max_occupied_houses = min(max_occupied_houses, new_occupied_houses)\n    return min_occupied_houses, max_occupied_houses\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    x = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    min_occupied_houses, max_occupied_houses = min_max_occupied_houses(x)\n    print(min_occupied_houses, max_occupied_houses)\n```\n\nThis solution first defines a function `count_occupied_houses` that calculates the number of occupied houses after all moves are performed.
